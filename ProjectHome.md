Simple and userfriendly script to maintain local repository of packages from AUR (so this is ONLY for Arch Linux). You have to define programs to be kept in your repo, local directory where compiled packages will be stored and modify pacman.conf file to list your local repository. Afterwards you can install local packages in the same way as from official repositories.

To do initial setup visit http://code.google.com/p/repokeeper/wiki/Introduction or read enclosed README, or just run the script - its output is quite talkative and will instruct you what to do.
